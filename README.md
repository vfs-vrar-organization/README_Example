### High Concept

Frenemies is a 2.5D local co-op puzzle game for three players. The game takes place inside the belly of a dragon who has eaten a chunk of the kingdom’s castle along with our protagonists. Now our three brave heroes must find a way to defeat the giant beast. Fortunately for them, upon being swallowed, our heroes found three magic hats, which grant the user a unique special ability when worn: a mage hat that allows them to freeze, an archer hat with a bow included and a barbarian hat with a strong hammer. Weirdly enough it seems like these abilities are supposed to be used on your friends! Freeze, Impale on walls or swing your friend like a golf ball! 
Embark in this "friendly" adventure with two others until you reach the dragon’s heart, slay the dragon, and save the kingdom.
